## Capstone project for IBM Data Science Certification
 This project is the final requirement for the IBM DAta Science Professional certificate


## Project Description
SpaceX is the most successful company of the commercial space age, making space travel affordable. The company advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. Based on public information and machine learning models, we are going to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
